Below are notes about the various options available, originally provided
for the aqd wrapper script.

To start aqd:
./sbin/aqd.py aqd

This will create a aqd.log in the current directory and daemonize the
process.  Run ./aqd with no args or ./aqd aqd --help (different)
for more options.

To start aqd but keep it in the foreground with logs going to stdout:
./sbin/aqd.py -no -l - aqd

Ditto, but without expecting to talk to knc:
./sbin/aqd.py -no -l - aqd --noauth

Setup keytab before running aqd to run as system user (i.e. cdb)
krb5_keytab

And then, assuming you are in a directory owned by your normal user id,
so cdb won't be able to write to ./aqd.pid:
./sbin/aqd.py -no -l - --pidfile=/var/tmp/cdb/aqd.pid aqd

Or as a daemon:
./sbin/aqd.py --pidfile=/var/tmp/cdb/aqd.pid --logfile=/var/tmp/cdb/aqd.log aqd

Adding --spew gives much twisted debug output.

To stop aqd:
If running with -no (foreground), ctrl-c will bring the server down
gracefully.  Otherwise, kill -TERM `cat aqd.pid` works as well.

To run aq:
./bin/aq.py [commands]

To run aq without knc:
./bin/aq.py --noauth --aqport=6901 --aqservice=cdb [commands]

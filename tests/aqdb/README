To execute the full automated aqdb test suite, invoke the 'runose' command in
this directory, while you are sitting in this directory since it uses the
nose default of looking in the cwd for tests to run.

If you are performing iterative testing where you don't need a clean db 
rebuild *everytime* you run a test, run with --no-rebuild. Don't let this 
rebuild behavior be an excuse not to write tear_down() functions that remove
any data created, this breaks things and makes tests less usable for all.

Permissions are significant to nose's automated test collections. By default,
nose will *NOT* run any module that is executable. 

The things that are executable in this directory, especially build_db, 
runnose, orderedsuite and test_utils are executable so
that they won't run as a part of the fully automated noserun system.

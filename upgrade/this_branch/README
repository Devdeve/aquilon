1. Run the 'address_fixes.py' script. If there is no mention of skipped entries
in the output, then edit the script, comment out the exception, and replace the
session.rollback() call with session.commit().

If the script prints out entries it skips, inspect them manually, and decide if
it is possible to fix them up manually.

2. Run the modified 'address_fixes.py' script again.

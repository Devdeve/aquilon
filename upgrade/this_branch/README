Order of execution where $LOGIN is (id@database):

Zeroth, shut down the broker and snapshot the database.

First, create the new tables and update existing ones:
yasql $LOGIN @git_workflow

Second, clean out some cruft from past upgrades.  This is very specific
to the production database and won't work anywhere else:
yasql $LOGIN @constraint_cleanup

Run the constraint renamer by launching:
AQDCONF=/etc/aqd.conf ../../lib/python2.5/aquilon/aqdb/shell.py

And then:
from aquilon.aqdb.utils import constraints
constraints.rename_non_null_check_constraints(db, debug=True)

Afterwards, purge the recycle bin:
yasql $LOGIN @purge_recycle_bin

In parallel with that, run the script to restructure domains:
./template_king.sh

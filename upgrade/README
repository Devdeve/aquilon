Put schema migrations for whatever branch into this_branch. 

When we figure out what release it's going into, move it
into there and leave it there.

General rules for performing schema upgrades:

- When upgrading from version A to version B, you must run all
  the upgrade scripts for versions A + 1, A + 2, ..., B.

- If there is a README file in the subdirecrory of a given version,
  follow the procedures listed there.

- If there are no version specific README, then you should execute all
  the scripts that are relevant to your installation:

  - .sql extension: for Oracle database, to be run using "sqlplus @<script>.sql"
  - .psql extension: for PostgreSQL databasee to be run using "psql -f <script>.psql"
  - .py extension: all databases, run it from the directory the script is in

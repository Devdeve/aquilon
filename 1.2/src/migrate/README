-------

To run the upgrade:
- Set up an appropriate aqd.conf, probably based off of unittest.conf but
	pointing at the database to update.
- Use run_update.py (with AQDCONF set) to export the database as a backup
	and then update the schema.
- Again with AQDCONF set, cd to ../lib/python/aquilon/aqdb and run ./network.py.
- [ If testing, run the unit tests against this database with
	./runtests.py --config=$AQDCONF ]
- Make sure the broker's aqd.conf has been updated to 1.1.1 (probably
	starting with etc/aqd.conf.example).
- Start up the broker.

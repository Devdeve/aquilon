This should eventually turn into wrapper scripts that look like the
current (1.0) aq/aqd...

For now...

To start aqd:
./twistd aqd

This will create a twistd.log in the current directory and daemonize the
process.  Run ./twistd with no args or ./twistd aqd --help (different)
for more options.

To start aqd but keep it in the foreground with logs going to stdout:
./twistd -no -l - aqd

Ditto, but without expecting to talk to knc:
./twistd -no -l - aqd --noknc

If running as quattor, try:
./twistd -no -l - --pidfile=/var/tmp/quattor/aqd.pid aqd

Or as a daemon:
./twistd --pidfile=/var/tmp/quattor/aqd.pid --logfile=/var/tmp/quattor/aqd.log aqd

Adding --spew gives much twisted debug output.

To run aq:
./aq.py [commands]

To run aq without knc:
./aq.py --noknc --aqport=6901 [commands]

Options should be the same / similar to options to aq 1.0.

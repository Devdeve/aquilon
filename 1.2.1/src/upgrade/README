This directory and the files herein are intended to be used during the
migration from the previous version of the source (1.1.1) to this
version (1.2).

The contain some cut-and-paste code from libraries present in the aqdb
module for the creation of new tables.

The 1.1 -> 1.1.1 upgrade was more sophisticated - look there for other
examples.

To run the upgrade:
- Set up an appropriate aqd.conf, probably based off of unittest.conf but
	pointing at the database to update.
- Use run_update.py (with AQDCONF set) to export the database as a backup
	and then update the schema.
- [ If testing, run the unit tests against this database with
	./runtests.py --config=$AQDCONF ]
- Start up the broker.

This is totally different for 1.2 -> 1.2.1. 

jobs: 

NETWORK:
    -nuke network, completely rebuild.
    
IFACES:
    -add varchar type column to interface
    -move mac column from phyical_interface to interface.
       
        -change the ip column from varchar to numeric
        -add the column to the interface:
            alter tab
    -add network_id column to interface.

Location:
    swap in varchar type column: make this a generic function

See if the precision completely f's it all up. if so, edit every table?


GENERIC TYPE_ID -> TYPE conversion:

select id/type from type table, save as 2 immutable dictionaries.
add type column to table. update table with an enum for each type.
drop type_id column + constraints
add non_null constraint to column

needed for system, interface, and location


To run the upgrade:

- Set up an appropriate aqd.conf, probably based off of unittest.conf but
	pointing at the database to update.
- Use run_update.py (with AQDCONF set) to export the database as a backup
	and then update the schema.
- [ If testing, run the unit tests against this database with
	./runtests.py --config=$AQDCONF ]
- Start up the broker.
